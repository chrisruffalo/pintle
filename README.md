# Pintle

## What?
Pintle is a forwarding DNS server.

## Why?
Against my better judgement I have decided to follow up my smash-hit 
[gudgeon](https://github.com/chrisruffalo/gudgeon) with a Java version. 
Golang never felt like it had the tooling or the structures to support
what I wanted to do and the number of bugs continued to grow and grow.# pintle
