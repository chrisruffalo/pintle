# a minimal configuration file presented to give an idea of the most basic use-case. this
# version listens on 0.0.0.0:53/udp and sends requests to the google resolvers, in order,
# at 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 on udp port 5050. a single block list at /path/to/block.list
# will block any domain in that list (return nxdomain).
