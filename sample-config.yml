pintle:
  # the endpoints where clients make requests to pintle over the network. pintle
  # supports udp, tcp, and mdns.
  listeners:
    - # all listeners have a name so that they can be
      # referenced by the application.
      name: basic-udp
      # the available types are tcp, udp, and mdns
      type: udp
      # udp and tcp need address to bind on, if none is given
      # the default is "0.0.0.0" or "all"
      addresses:
        - 0.0.0.0
      # udp and tcp need a port to listen on
      port: 5353
    - # this is a basic tcp listener, generally this is used for specialty cases
      # and larger data streams but pintle supports tcp as well
      name: basic-tcp
      type: tcp
      port: 5353
  # pintle has the ability to read device names and address. what this means is that
  # when a mdns query is answered the answers will be placed in the cache.
  # mdns only supports answers that end in `.local` so dns queries looking
  # for something in the `.local` TLD can be answered by pintle using
  # this method. this also allows it to name-resolve IoT and device clients in the UI.
  mdns:
    # mdns will only be activated on the following interfaces. if no
    # interfaces are listed mdns is disabled. if the key word "all" is
    # found in this list then all interfaces will be tried.
    interfaces:
      - "all"
  # lists are the sources of blocking/allowing information for queries. before a query is serviced
  # by a resolver it can be routed through lists and an action (explicit block, explicit allow) can
  # be taken. this is used to stop traffic from going outbound or explicitly allowing certain hostnames
  # to be resolved.
